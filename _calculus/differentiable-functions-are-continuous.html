  <h2>Differentiable Functions are Continuous</h2>
  Let $A\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$, $\vec{a}\in \text{int}(A)$, and $f:A\to\mathbb{R}^m$. If $f$ is differentiable at $\vec{A}$, then it is continuous at $\vec{a}$.

  <h2>Concepts</h2>
  If a function is differentiable at a point, then it has to be continuous at a point.<br> this seems to only apply for single variable functions. Multivariable, you can have a function that's not continuous at a point but the derivative still existing. Is it because of the different limit needing to exist?

  <h2>Hypothesis</h2>
  The function needs to be differentiable, as the one-variable limit definition of derivatives is used in the proof.

  <h2>Proof</h2>
  To prove that it is continuous at a point, we need the limit of $f(a+h)-f(a)$ to go to $0$ as $h$ goes to $0$. Notice how this is the numerator in the definition of the derivative. <hr>
  Let $f$ be a function, and let $f$ be differentiable at $a$. Then for any $h\neq= 0$, we have
  $$\begin{align*}
  f(a+h)-f(a)=h\cdot\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}
\end{align*}$$. Taking the limit as $h$ goes to $0$, we get
$$\begin{align*}
\lim_{h\to 0}[f(a+h)-f(a)]&=\lim_{h\to 0}\times \lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}\\
&=0\times f'(a)
&=0,
\end{align*}$$ and hence
$$\begin{align*}
\lim_{h\to 0}f (a+h)=f(a)
\end{align*}$$
Let $x=a+h$. Then $\lim_{h\to 0}f(a+h)=\lim_{x\to a}f(x)$ giving
$$\begin{align*}
\lim_{h\to 0} f(a+h)&=f(a)\\
\lim_{x\to a}f(x)&=f(a)
\end{align*}$$.
Hence <a href="">\lim_{x\to a}f(x) = f(a) </a> means the function the continuous at $a$.
