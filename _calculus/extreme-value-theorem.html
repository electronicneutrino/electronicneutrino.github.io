  <h2>The Extreme Value Theorem</h2>
  Let $K$ be a nonempty compact subset of $\mathbb{R}^n$ and let $f:K\to\mathbb{R}$ be a continuous function. Then there exists $\vec{a}, \vec{b}\in K$ such that $f(\vec{a})\leq f(\vec{x})\leq f(\vec{b})$ for all $\vec{x}\in K$.

  <h2>Proof</h2>
  $K$ is compact and $f$ is continuous implies that $f(K)$ is compact which means $f(K)$ is closed and bounded.
  <hr>
  $f(K)\subseteq\mathbb{R}$ is nonempty and bounded. Then there exists some $M=\text{sup}f(K)$ exists. By the definition of a supremum, a sequence $(y_k)_{k=1}^{\infty}$ in $f(k)$ such thta $M-\frac{1}{k}<y_k\leq M$ for all $k\geq 1$. This sequence converges to $M$. Since $f(K)$ is closed, then that means $M\in f(K)$, which means that there exists some $\vec{b}\in K$ such that $f(\vec{b})=M$.
  <hr>
  A similar argument for the infinimum.
