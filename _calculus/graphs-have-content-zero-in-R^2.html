  <h2>Content of Graphs</h2>
  Let $f\in C([a, b], \mathbb{R})$ with $a<b$. Then the graph $G:=\{(x, f(x)):x\in[a, b] \}\subseteq\mathbb{R}^2$ has content zero.

  Even though this says that $\mu(G)=\int_{\mathbb{R}^2}\chi d(x, y)=0$, we can't actually directly calculate the integral, so we take a different method for proving it.

  <h2>Proof</h2>
  We use the fact that the graph is uniformly continuous, and the if and only if condition for zero content. That is, we use the fact that $G$ is uniformly continuous to show that for all $\epsilon>0$, there exists a finite set of boxes $\{I_i\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n:1\leq i\leq m\}$ such that
  $$\begin{align}
G\subseteq\bigcup_{i=1}^n I_i
\end{align}$$  and $$\begin{align}
\sum_{i=1}^n \mu(I_i)< \epsilon.
\end{align}$$<hr>
Since $f$ is continuous and bounded on the closed domain $[a, b]$, then $f$ is uniformly continuous on $[a, b]$. That means for all $\epsilon'>0$, where $\epsilon'>2(b-a)\epsilon$, there exists some $\delta>0$ such that $|f(x)-f(y)|<\epsilon'$ for all $x, y$ that satisfies $|x-y|<\delta$. <br>
We partition the interval $[a, b]$ into segments of length $\frac{n-a}{N}$ such that $\delta>\frac{b-a}{N}$ (ie. $N>\frac{b-a}{N}$). <br>
Let $x_i=a+\frac{b-a}{N}$, and $I_j=x_i\times 2\epsilon'$. Being uniformly continuous, the graph is contained in $I_j$, and the volume of $I_j$ is $\frac{b-a}{N}2\epsilon'$ meaning $\mu(I_j)=2\frac{b-a}{N}\epsilon'$. Then $\sum_{j=1}^n\mu(I_j)=2(b-a)\epsilon'<\epsilon$. Hence by the condition for content zero, $G$ has content zero.
