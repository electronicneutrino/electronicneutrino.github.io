  <h2>Conditions for a square matrix having a unique solution</h2>

  If $A$ is square, then $Ax=0$ has a unique solution $(x= 0)$ if and only if $A$ is row equivalent to the identity matrix.  <br>

<div id="hypothesis">
  <h2>If</h2>
  We require that $A$ is row equivalent to the identity matrix. This would mean $Ax=0$ has the same solution as $I_n x=0$, where $I_n$ is the $n\times n$ identity matrix.

<div id="proof">
  <h2>Proof</h2>
  We use the fact that two row equivalent matrices have the same solution, and only the identity matrix has a unique solution for $Ax=0$.
