<!-- Definition goes here -->
<div id="definition">
  A linear transformation $T:U\to U$ is <mark>invertible</mark> if there exists a linear transformation $T^{-1}:U\to U$ such that $TT^{-1}=T^{-1}T=I$. <br>
  Furthermore if $T:V\to V$, where $V$ is finite dimensional, is left or right invertible, then $T$ is invertible.

  As usual a function is invertible if and only if its bijective. This means that if $R$ is invertible, then $R$ has no zero rows (if it has zero rows, it would not be subjective).<br>
  For infinite matrices, it's possible that it is only left or right invertible, but not the other. For instance,

  $$\begin{align*}
A=\begin{bmatrix}
0 & 0 & 0 & \dots \\
1 & 0 & 0 & \dots \\
0 & 1 & 0 & \dots \\
\vdots & \vdots & \vdots &\ddots
 \end{bmatrix}
\end{align*}$$
$A$ is left invertible but it is not right invertible. <br>
If $A$ and $B$ are invertible, then so is $AB$, where $(AB)^{-1}=B^{-1}A^{-1}$. This holds for a an arbitrary number of matrices.
<br>
The inverse is calculated using block matrices. Let $R$ be a row reduced echelon matrix that is row equivalent to $A$. Note that $A$ is invertible if and only if $R$ is the identity matrix. <br>
There also exists a matrix $P$ which is the product of elementary matrices such that $R=PA$, as $R$ is row equivalent to $A$. Since $R=I_n$, this implies that $P=A^{-1}$. <br>
We form an augmented matrix, $[A|I_n]$. Multiplying this augmented matrix by $P$ then gives the new augmented matrix
$$\begin{align*}
P[A|I_n] &= [PA| P]\\
&=[R|P]\\
&=[I_n|P],
\end{align*}$$
and so $[A|I_n]$ is row equivalent to $[I_n|P]$
Hence to compute $A^{-1}$, we form the augmented matrix  $[A|I_n]$ then row reduce until we get an augmeted matrix of the form $[I_n|A]$.
