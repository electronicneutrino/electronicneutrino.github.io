<div id="definition">
  Two matrices $A$ and $B$ are row equivalent if we can get from $A$ to $B$ with a finite amount of row operations. <br>
  The elementary row operations are
  <ul>
    <li>multiply a row by a nonzero scalar</li>
    <li>add the scalar multiple of a row to another</li>
    <li>interchange rows</li>
  </ul>
  and each operation can be undone or inverted with another elementary row operation of some kind.
