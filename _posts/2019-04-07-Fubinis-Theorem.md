Let $A\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$ and $B\subseteq\mathbb{R}^m$ be two boxes and let $f:A\times B\to\mathbb{R}$ be a bounded and integrable function on $A\times B$. If for each $\vec{x}\in A$, the function $f(\vec{x}, \cdot)$ is integrable on $B$, then $\int_B f(\cdot, \vec{y})d\vec{y}$ is integrable on $A$ and 

$$\int_{[A\times B]} f(\vec{x}, \vec{y}) d(\vec{x}, \vec{y})=\int_{A}\left[\int_{B}f(\vec{x}, \vec{y} d\vec{y})\right]d\vec{x}$$

Proof: To be added later since I don't need to know it for the exam.
