Let $A\subseteq\mathbb{R}^n$, $\vec{a}\in \text{int}(A)$, $F:A\to\mathbb{R}^m$. Let $r>0$ be such that $B_r(\vec{a})\subseteq A$. If all partial derivatives $\frac{\partial f_i}{\partial x_j}(\vec{x})$ exists for $1\leq i\leq m$, $1\leq j\leq n$ on $B_r(\vec{a})$ and are continuous at $\vec{a}$, then $f$ is differentiable at $\vec{a}$.

Questions: Why is it all partial derivatives exist and not all directional derivatives exist?
