  <h2>Postulate 1</h2>
  The state of a quantum mechanics system, including all the information that is known about it, is mathematically represented by a normalized vector know as a <mark>ket</mark>, denoted with $|\psi\rangle$.

  <h2>Postulate 2</h2>
  An <mark>operator</mark> is a mathetmatical object that acts on a ket and transforms it into a new ket.

  <h2>Postulate 3</h2>
  The only possible results of a measurement of a observable is one of the <mark>eigenvectors</mark> of the corresponding operator.
</div>

<div id="results">
  <h2>Postulate 4</h2>
  The probability of observing an eigenvalue (with the associated eigenvector $|\phi\rangle$) in a measurement of an observable on a system in the state $|\psi\rangle$ is
  $$\begin{align}
P_{\pm}=|\langle \phi | \psi\rangle | ^2
\end{align}$$

<div id="proof">
  <h2>Postulate 5</h2>
  After a measurement of $A$ that yields the result $a_n$ (one of the eigenvalues) of the quantum state is in
  $$\begin{align}
|\psi\rangle =\frac{\mathbb{P}_n|\psi\rangle}{\sqrt{\langle \psi|\mathbb{P}_n|\psi\rangle}}
\end{align}$$

<div id="proof2">
  <h2>Postulate 6</h2>
  The time evolution of a quantum system is determined by the total energy of the system through the Hamiltonian operator $H(t)$ according to the schrodinger's equation
  $$\begin{align}
i\hbar\frac{d}{dt}|\psi(t)\rangle = H(t)|\psi(t)\rangle
\end{align}$$
