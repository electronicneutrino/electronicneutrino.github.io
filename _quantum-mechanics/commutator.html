<div id="overview">
  Two operators $A$ and $B$ are said to <mark>commute</mark> if $[A, B]=0$, where $[A, B]$ is a <mark>commutator</mark> defined as
  $$\begin{align*}
[A, B]=AB-BA
\end{align*}$$
</div>

<!-- Notations -->
<div id="notations">
  <h2>Notations</h2>
  The notation $[A, B]$ is shorthand used to denote the commutator, where $[A, B]=AB-BA$. If two operators commute, then we simply write $[A, B]=0$.

  <h2>Concepts</h2>
  <h3>If $A$ and $B$ commute, they have the same eigenstates</h3>
  There's a proof for this
  <hr>
  Let $A, B$ be two operators. If $A$ and $B$ commute, then $AB=BA$. If $A$ and $B$ don't commute, and $[A, B]=C$, then we can write $AB-BA=C$, or rearrange it into $AB=C+BA$ or $BA=AB-C$
  <hr>
  If two operators commute, then they can be both measured at the same time. Otherwise, they cannot both be known at the same time.
