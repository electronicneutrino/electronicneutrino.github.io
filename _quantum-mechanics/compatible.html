<div id="overview">
  Two observables $A$ and $B$ are <mark>compatible</mark> if their commutator is zero. That is, $[A, B]=0$.

<!-- Notations -->
<div id="notations">
  <h2>Notations</h2>
  There seems to be no definite notation but often the commutator notation of $[A, B]=0$ is used to mean that $A$, $B$ are compatible.

 <h3>$A$ and $B$ share the same eigenstates</h3>
 This follows from $A$ and $B$ sharing eigenstates if $[A, B]=0$.
