<div id="overview">
  An operator is <mark>hermitian</mark> if $A=A^{\dagger}$, were $A^{\dagger}$ is the hermitian conjungate of $A$. For a operator $A^{\dagger}$ to be the hermitian conjungate of $A$, we need to satisfy
  $$\begin{align}
\langle \phi| A\psi\rangle = \langle A^{\dagger}\phi |\psi\rangle.
\end{align}$$ The method to find the Hermitian differs depending on the operator.

  All quantum mechanics operators are hermitian conjungate, as we need it to work no matter if we apply the operator on the right or the left. <br>
  For constant operators, the hermitian conjungate is the complex conjungate of the matrix. <br>
  Hermitian operators always have real eigenvalues and its eigenvectors form an orthonormal basis.
