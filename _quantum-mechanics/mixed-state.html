  Mixed states are often represented with density matrices, as they <i>cannot</i> be represented by a state vector.

  We can differetiate a classical mixture of pure states from solely pure states by putting them through matrices.
  <br>
  Suppose we have a collection of particles in the state $\ket{\psi}=\ket{+}_{x}$, and a classical mixture of $\ket{+}_z$ and $\ket{-}_z$. We can differentiate the two states by measuring their spin in their $x$ axis, as all of the pure state would be observed to be $+\frac{\hbar}{2}$. The classical mixture would be both $\ket{+}_z$ and $\ket{-}_z$ randomly being measured $+\frac{\hbar}{2}$ or $-\frac{\hbar}{2}$, in contrast to the pure state which only gives measurements of $+\frac{\hbar}{2}$.
