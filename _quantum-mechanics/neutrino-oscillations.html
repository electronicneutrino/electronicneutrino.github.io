  <h2>Derivation</h2>
  The energy of a neutrino is
  $$\begin{align*}
E&=\sqrt{m^2c^4+p^2c^2} \\
&\approx pc + \frac{m_ic^2}^2{2pm}
\end{align*}$$. <br>
Assume that $v_e$ and $v_{\mu}$ are quantum states of a spin-1/2 system. Then the state of a neutrino is a linear superposition of eigenstates of the Hamiltonian (energy) $|v_1\rangle$ and $|v_2\rangle$ with respective energies $pc+\frac{m_1^2c^4}{2pc}$ and $pc+\frac{m^2_2c^4}{2pc}$. Then we can write $|v_e\rangle$ and $|v_{\mu}\rangle$ in terms of the possible measurements of energy for
$$\begin{align*}
|v_e\rangle &= a|v_1\rangle + b|v_2\rangle \\
|v_{\mu}\rangle = c|v_1\rangle + d|v_2\rangle
\end{align*}$$
We initialize the system in $|v_e\rangle$. Then the probability of a change in flavour is the same as the probability of a spin flip, which means
$$\begin{align*}
\text{Prob}_{v_2\to v_{\mu}} \porp \sin^2[\frac{E_1-E_2}{2}t]
\end{align*}$$ which means that
$$\begin{align*}
E_1-E_2\prop(m_1^2-m_2^2),
\end{align*}$$ which neutrino oscillations are proportional to the difference of the squared mass of neutrios mass eigenstates.
