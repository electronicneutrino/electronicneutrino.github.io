<div id="overview">
In quantum, we require states to be normalized. This means that adding up probability for a state to be measured as it's allowed values, it has to add up to one.<br>
Unnormalized states need to be multiplied by a normalization constant.

<div id="significance">
  <h2>Significance</h2>
  For instance, for measuring spin, let $a$ denote the probabilty of measuring spin up, and $b$ denote the probability of measuring spin down. Since the particle must be in the state spin up or spin down, that means we require $a+b=1$.
  <br>
  For something continuous such as position, if we know a particle must be in a certain area, then the integral of finding the probability over that adds up to $1$.

  <h2>Derivation</h2>
  Let $\ket{\psi}$ be a state such that its possible outcomes are discrete states $\ket{\phi_1}, \dots, \ket{\phi_n}$. We require
  $$\begin{align*}
\sum_{k=1}^{n}\braket{\phi_k|\psi} =1
\end{align*}$$ <hr>
Let $\ket{\psi}$ be a state such that its possible measurement outcomes are continuous. Then we require
