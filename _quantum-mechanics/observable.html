<div id="overview">
  An <mark>observable</mark> is a quantity being measured in an quantum mechanical experiment. <br>
  Observables are denoted with mathematical notation to represent the measurement in a quantum system. For instance, in a Stern-Gerlache experiment, the observable is the spin angular momentum, mathematically denoted with $S_z$. It can be one of the eigenvalues of the associated operator.

  <h2>Notations</h2>
  Notation depends on what is the observable. It is a variable which represents the eigenvalues of the associated operator.

  <h2>Concepts</h2>
  In a general sense. Let's talk about the observable $A$. The measurement of the observable $A$ gives results of $A_1, A_2, \dots, A_n$, where $n$ may be finite or infinite. The quantum state associated with the observable result $A_i$ is $|a_i\rangle$.<br>
  $a_i$ can be imaginaryâ€” can it?
