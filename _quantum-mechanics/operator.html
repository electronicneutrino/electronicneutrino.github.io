  Operators tend to be matrices. Decomposed into its eigenvectors, it is written
  $$\begin{align}
A=\sum_{i}\alpha_i|a_i\rangle \langle a_i|
\end{align}$$

  <h2>Concepts</h2>
  The eigenvectors of an operator forms a basis for the Hilbert space, and so by definition of basis, every quantum state can be represented as a superposition of the eigenvectors of the operator. <br>
  The eigenvalues of the operator is the possible results of the measurement, where the associate eigenvector is the quantum state that has the measurement of the eigenvalue.
  <br>
  Hilbert space is defined by operators.
