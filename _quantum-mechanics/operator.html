  An <mark>operator</mark> is a mathematical object that acts on a ket and turns it into a new ket. See Postuate 2.

  Operators tend to be matrices. Decomposed into its eigenvectors, it is written
  $$\begin{align*}
A=\sum_{i}\alpha_i|a_i\rangle \langle a_i|,
\end{align*}$$ and its terms are
$$\begin{align*}
A_{ij}=\braket{\phi_i| A |\phi_j},
\end{align*}$$ where $\braket{\phi_i|A|\phi_j}$ is the probability of measuring the eigenstate of $\bra{\phi_i}$ on $A\ket{\phi_j}$, often given experimentally (?).

  <h2>Concepts</h2>
  The eigenvectors of an operator forms a basis for the Hilbert space, and so by definition of basis, every quantum state can be represented as a superposition of the eigenvectors of the operator. <br>
  The eigenvalues of the operator is the possible results of the measurement, where the associate eigenvector is the quantum state that has the measurement of the eigenvalue.
  <br>
  Hilbert space is defined by operators. <br>
  We sometimes (when? I think for measureable observables?) require that an operator acts correctly on both a bra and a ket. That is, if $A\ket{\alpha}=\ket{\beta}$, then we would like an associated operator such that $\bra{\alpha}A^{\dagger}=\bra{\beta}$. This is the Hermitian conjungate.
  <br>
  Operators can be writtin in terms of its eigenvector basis. This is the spectral decomposition of an operator.
