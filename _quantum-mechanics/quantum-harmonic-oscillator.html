This is kind of like a finite well, but instead we have the potential increasing in a quadratic function instead of a sudden jump. That is,
$$\begin{align}
V(x)=\frac{1}{2}kx^2
\end{align}$$ <br>
Classically, a particle would sit at the very bottom. Quantum mechanically, due to the uncertainty principle, the particle can't just sit at the bottom, having zero energy.

  Once again we want to solve the eigenvalue equation $H\psi=E\psi$, where $H$ is the Hamiltonian. The total energy of the system is the potential energy plus the kinetic energy. The kinetic energy, written in the position basis, is
  $$\begin{align}
-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{d^2\psi(x)}{dx^2},
\end{align}$$ while the potential energy is
$$\begin{align}
V(x)=\frac{1}{2}kx^2\psi(x).
\end{align}$$
This is a pain to solve. We use ladder operators. $\hat{H}$ can be written in terms of laddter operators, where
$$\begin{align}
\hat{H}=\hbar\omega\hat{a}^{\dagger}\hat{a}+\frac{1}{2}\hbar\omega
\end{align}$$
