This is kind of like a finite well, but instead we have the potential increasing in a quadratic function instead of a sudden jump. That is,
$$\begin{align*}
V(x)=\frac{1}{2}kx^2.
\end{align*}$$
Classically, a particle would sit at the very bottom. Quantum mechanically, due to the uncertainty principle, the particle can't just sit at the bottom, having zero energy.

  <h2>Derivation</h2>
  Once again we want to solve the eigenvalue equation $H\psi=E\psi$, where $H$ is the Hamiltonian. The total energy of the system is the potential energy plus the kinetic energy. The kinetic energy, written in the position basis, is
  $$\begin{align*}
-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{d^2\psi(x)}{dx^2},
\end{align*}$$ while the potential energy is
$$\begin{align*}
V(x)=\frac{1}{2}kx^2\psi(x).
\end{align*}$$
This is a pain to solve. We use ladder operators. $\hat{H}$ can be written in terms of ladder operators, where
$$\begin{align*}
\hat{H}=\hbar\omega\hat{a}^{\dagger}\hat{a}+\frac{1}{2}\hbar\omega,
\end{align*}$$ and $\hat{a}$ raises the energy level and $\hat{a}^{\dagger}$ lowers the energy. Thar means there's a state $\ket{E_0}$ for which the energy $E_0$ is the minimum possible energy for the system, and $\hat{a}|E_0\rangle=0$.
