  <h2>Spin</h2>
  Spin has no classical equivalent, as the electron is thought of as a point particle. The spin angular momentum comes from quantum field theory. <br>
The <mark>spin</mark> is a fundemental property of subatmic particles, and behaves like angular momentum.

  The spin of denoted with $\vec{s}$. <hr>
  The spin leads to an intrensic dipole moment $\vec{\mu}_s$, where the two are related by
  $$\begin{align*}
\vec{\mu}_s=g\frac{q}{2m}\vec{s},
\end{align*}$$
where $q$ is the charge of the particle, $g$ is the gyromagnetic ratio of the particle, and $m$ is the mass of the particle, where the derivation is similar to the classical magnetic dipole moment. <br>
For an electron, we get approximately
  $$\begin{align*}
\mu_s=-\frac{e}{m_e}\vec{s},
\end{align*}$$.

    Magnetic dipole momentâ€” a very simplified view is the electron is basically a tiny magnet in a circular orbit around the atom. By (something from electricity stuffs), let $A$ be the area enclosed by the loop, $T$ the time period of $e^-$ in the orbit, and $v$ the velocity of $e^-$. Then by (see I learned this but Forgot).
    $$\begin{align*}
  |\vec{\mu}_z|&=IA \\
  &=\frac{e}{T}\pi r^2\\
  &=\frac{e}{2\pi r/v}\pi r^2\\
  &=\frac{e}{2} vr\\
  &=\frac{e}{2m_e}m_e v r\\
  &=\frac{2}{2me}|\vec{L}|,
  \end{align*}$$
  and the direction follows the right hand rule.

  <hr>
  Fermions have fractional spin while bosons have integer spins. A spin of $0$ means no response to a magnetic field. For a particle of spin $s$, the
