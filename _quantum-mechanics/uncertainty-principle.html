The uncertainty principle says that for two operators $A$ and $B$, we have
$$\begin{align*}
\Delta A\cdot \Delta B \geq \frac{1}{2}|\langle[A, B]\rangle |
\end{align*}$$

  <h2>Significance</h2>
  If two operators don't commute, both values cannot be known with absolte certainty. Notice that it only tells you the product of the uncertainty, and not the minimum uncertainty of the fluctation of one operator. This means we can get a small uncertainty in one measurement that results in the large uncertainty for the other.
