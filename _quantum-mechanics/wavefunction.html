  For some quantum states such as position, the values are infinite. It would be inconvenient to represent it all in a column vector. So we represent it with a function.

  Often the wavefunction is denoted with $\psi(x)$, however it means the same thing as $\langle x|\psi\rangle$. That is,
  $$\begin{align}
\psi(x)=\langle x|\psi\rangle
\end{align}$$

  We can think of a column vector as descrete points on a graph. If we have enough of those descrete points, then can form a function, perhaps continuous. <br>
  I guess the values of the equation is solved by the eigenvector equation of the operator (not the schrodinger's equation).
